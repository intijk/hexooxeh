一段描述并行计算的话,写的很诗意:
<pre gutter="false" class="brush:plain">"Up to now, most software has been like music written for a solo performer; 
with the current generation of chips we're getting a little experience with
duets and quartets and other small ensembles; but scoring a work for large
orchestra and chorus is a different kind of challenge."
              ---------Brian Hayes, Computing in a Parallel Universe, 2007.
